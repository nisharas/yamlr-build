## 🛡️ Pro feature Deep Dive (Verified)

### 1. The Healing Quota Guardrail
Yamlr Free allows unlimited `scan` (audit) operations. However, actual `heal` (remediation) is limited to **5 distinct files per 24-hour period**. This is enforced locally in `~/.yamlr/quota.json`.
- **Pro users** have unlimited healing across all workspaces.

### 2. Epistemic Repair (Industrial Trauma)
Pro users gain access to "Epistemic Repair" algorithms. These fix common Kubernetes configuration "trauma" where maps are incorrectly used as lists (or vice-versa), such as:
```yaml
# From this (Invalid):
env:
  DEBUG: "true"
# To this (Fixed):
env:
  - name: DEBUG
    value: "true"
```
This is gated in `SchemaHealer.clean_value` and requires a Pro license.

### 3. Sovereign Export & Native Acceleration
- **Sovereign Export**: Pro users see their YAML files automatically sorted according to Kubernetes conventions (e.g., `apiVersion` and `kind` always at the top).
- **Native Acceleration**: Uses a custom Rust extension (`--fast`) to process massive repositories with sub-millisecond latency.

### 4. Semantic DNA & Receipts
Yamlr Pro calculates a **Semantic DNA hash** for every manifest. This hash represents the "meaning" of the file, ignoring whitespace and comments. Pro users can generate **Compliance Receipts** (`--receipt`) that prove a manifest has been validated and hardened by the Yamlr engine, suitable for SOC2/ISO audits.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Preview Mode**: You can test all Pro features for free using the `--pro-preview` flag. This will simulate all Pro healing logic in your terminal (using `--dry-run` and `--diff`) so you can see the value before upgrading.
