**Kubernetes validates syntax. Yamlr ensures cross-resource integrity and safe, comment-preserving auto-repair.**

`kubectl apply` checks schema syntax for individual resources in isolation. Yamlr builds a complete relational model across your workloads, services, ingresses, and policies to catch silent outages before they reach production.

Built with a native Rust core, Yamlr scans and repairs Kubernetes manifests. Its source-aware processing is designed to retain comments and formatting for supported transformations; review and validate changes before applying them.

## Key Capabilities

- **Cross-Resource Outage Prevention** — Catches Service-to-Workload port mismatches, orphaned Ingress backends, and selector collisions.
- **Comment-Preserving Auto-Repair (`yamlr heal`)** — Fixes deprecated APIs, missing resource limits, and selector typos without losing inline comments, quotes, or indentation.
- **Air-Gapped & Local-First** — 100% offline analysis. Zero data egress, zero telemetry requirements, and hermetic execution.
- **Reproducible Performance** — Sub-50ms scans for 100 files; sub-500ms for 1,000 files via the native binary.
- **SARIF & CI/CD Native** — Emits standard SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Code Scanning, GitLab CI, and pre-commit hooks.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Scan manifests against Kubernetes 1.30 schema
yamlr scan ./k8s --k8s-version 1.30

# Preview safe auto-repairs with visual diff
yamlr heal ./k8s

# Apply repairs in-place (atomic write-and-rename)
yamlr heal ./k8s --apply
```

## Why Yamlr?

Yamlr is architected for **Safe Automation**:

* **Lossless AST Sharding**: Modifies only the offending lines while preserving surrounding comments, vertical rhythm, and scalar formatting.
* **Topological Dependency Graph**: Validates relationships across ConfigMaps, Secrets, RBAC, Services, and Deployments.
* **Zero-Failure Invariant**: All automated mutations converge in a single step and pass official Kubernetes OpenAPI v3 validation.

## CLI Overview

```bash
yamlr scan ./k8s      # Audit manifests for syntax and semantic bugs
yamlr heal ./k8s      # Preview or apply comment-preserving repairs
yamlr graph ./k8s     # Render topological dependency graph
yamlr drift ./k8s     # Detect multi-version API drift
yamlr doctor          # Self-diagnostic check for local environment
```

## Engineering Standards

Yamlr is built with strict systems engineering principles:
- **Rust Native Core**: Memory-safe execution with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- **Idempotency**: All heal operations produce identical SHA-256 hashes across consecutive runs.
- **Open Standards**: SARIF 2.1.0, OpenAPI v3, and standard Linux exit codes (0 = pass, 1 = violations).
